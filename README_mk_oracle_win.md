# Oracle Plugin for Windows

This subproject is a complete rewrite of the mk_oracle.ps1 to monitor Oracle databases. It tries to use the provided .net modules for a better performance of the plugin.

## ToDo
* Add more features of the Linux mk_oracle (since this is the feature reference)
* Add features to simply use the original SQL queries from the linux plugin (makes it better maintainable)
* Make it more robust (at the moment only tested with Oracle XE 18c)
